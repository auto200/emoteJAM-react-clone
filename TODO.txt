Note that you cannot add more filters (or maby you can add just one). The reason
is that each preview is a separate canvas, with it's own webgl context and there
is a maximum limit of webgl contexts that you can create, determinated by the
browser. So the plan is to render all the previews in single canvas and have
separate canvas designed to render the gif OR introduce pagination, this seems a
bit easier
